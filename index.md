### Patrick Connolly

I often find myself walking through spaces that capitalism isn't curious
about.

Someday there might be more here, but for now, I keep [notes](notes).

I co-organize with [Civic Tech Toronto](http://civictech.ca) as a civic
technologist. Am prone to wanderings, but actively orbiting Toronto,
sussing out deeper gravity wells. Sometimes I live in a hammock in the
park. Minimalist.
