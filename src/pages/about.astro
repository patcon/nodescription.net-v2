        Hello! My name's Patrick Connolly, but the internet usually lets me go by
        "patcon".
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a <strong>software developer</strong> and <strong>civic hacker</strong>. For me, that means that I'm
        interested in the <em>material</em> and the <em>meta</em> of civic life. Which is to say both
        the tangible day-to-day, and the more abstract systems which underpin that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spend my time trying to help government and civic systems work more like the
        open-source communities I know and love.
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary affiliation (ie. the one I'm most proud of), is being an <strong>animator</strong>
        within the <a href="http://civictech.ca">Civic Tech Toronto</a> community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to say that I spend time in spaces that capitalism isn't curious
        about. It's understandably hard to get paid doing that work, so <strong>please
        consider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/patcon">supporting me on Patreon</a></strong> if you've been positively
        affected by things I help maintain!

        No amount is too small -- My gratitude isn't tied to any dollar amounts!
        If money isn't the way you move in the world, then no worries :)
