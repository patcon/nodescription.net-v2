(Building on [some previous thoughts of language as an organism](#2019-07-13).)

So if language is the organism, then what are it's lifecycles. It
perhaps becomes interesting to think of language or all sorts as
"living", even when it's written on a wall. Perhaps it's best conceived
of as a dormat stage of the language organism.

So when words are written on the east wall, and words are written on the
west wall, they are dormat. They are concepts and ideas that cannot
combine and remix. These ideas cannot fuck. They can't generate new
ideas together, with pieces of one and pieces of another married and
intertwined.

But a-ha! So here comes the human mind: the fertile replication machines
of the system. It can consume and take in the dormant form of the
language organism on the east wall, and the dormant form on the west,
and it can bring it into a shared space that recombines and remixes, and
finds the best parts of each to shape together and act.

So perhaps the human mind is better conceived as the biological
replication machinery of the language organism -- the mind is the
fertile environment of recombination, not unlike DNA polymerase is the
replication machinery of the cellular environment, or the _cellular_
milieu. And so our minds are like the piece of the giant system moving
through the _terrestial_ milieu -- through the thin skin of matter than
wraps the earth and drifts with purpose within the viscosity of the
atmosphere.
