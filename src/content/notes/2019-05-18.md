The [complexity video][complexity-vid-ants] that I linked yesterday
talked about the steps that ants follow to make decisions on placing a
new nest: info-gathering, evaluation, deliberation, consensus-building,
choice, implementation.

Curious whether there are analogies to how people engage in
individual-to-individual collaborations (person offering support to
person), but also more complex collabs. As in, up through more advanced
forms like individual-to-group (person offering support to other group),
or even group-to-group collabs (group offering support to another
group).  This last one is understandably the most complicated way to
work together, because knowing self and other as a group is so much
harder and less intuitive for our individual sensibilities to navigate.
