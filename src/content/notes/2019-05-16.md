(Thinking [back](#2019-05-12-a) on the intuitions involved in our
conscious experiences) Maybe the evolved trait that is consciousness, is
more about how we feel the sensation of the ride. Like a surfer's
developed instincts, honed for riding waves. We can carve that wave, and
enjoy the simple thrill of navigating it, but the major aspects of the
experience -- the orientation, the shore as ultimate destination -- is a
force beyond our control.
