As a co-organizer, I help run weekly hacknights that bring together designers, coders, urban planners, government staff, mappers, policy-makers, students, communications strategists, and all other Torontonians who share an interest in <b>making Toronto more responsive, prosperous, sustainable and equitable, through design, tech, and data.</b>
