<p>A few friends were in NYC for a hacker conference, and happened to converge on a talk called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiIBiV0UbLI">Hacking Housing</a>. It was hosted by some folks who'd created a scrappy incubator in Oakland, CA for building DIY "shipping container homes". As the talk ended, we each leaned forward and looked at one another with expressions of barely contained excitement. We committed then-and-there to regular meetings and working toward something similar in Toronto.</p><p>It's been a work in progress.</p>
