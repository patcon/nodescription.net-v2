<p>Living in Nicaragua gave me a taste for the good work I could get done when my costs were low. But my community was in Toronto, a very expensive city to live in. Frustrated with these tensions, I started looking for alternatives. I spent the summer months adapting my daily habits so that I didn't need an apartment.</p><p>I've now grown comfortable camping full-time in parks in SF & TO. This allows me to dedicate more time towards trying to create <i>real</i> value in the world, without worrying whether that value can immediately be transformed into money.</p>
