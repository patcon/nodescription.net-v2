As part of the Canadian government's consultation on electoral reform, they created a survey at <a href="https://www.mydemocracy.ca">MyDemocracy.ca</a>. The tool itself provoked a mixed response. Excited by another tool called <a href="https://pol.is/gov">Pol.is</a>, a friend and I decided to launch a complementary effort: <a href="https://mydem0cracy.ca">MyDemØcracy.ca</a>
